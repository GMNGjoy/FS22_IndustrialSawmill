# Industrial Sawmill
This is an all-platforms version of the [BandsawMill](https://github.com/GMNGjoy/FS22_BandsawMill) that I have been working on for a few months, and the first mod with a custom model that I will be pushing up to ModHub. Thank you to my channel supporters for helping purchase this model, and allowing me to get a bandsaw mill out for all platforms!


## Description from the ModDesc
> Tired of driving across the entire map to sell your wood, or want a small and efficient sawmill directly on your farm? This mod is for you.
>
> A homestead-sized sawmill for your farm with two versions to either serve as a direct-sellpoint or a sawmill production. Depending on the style of your farm the sawmill is also available in a "rusty but trusty" look.
>
> PLACEABLES:
> - Industrial Sawmill (sellpoint) : Sellpoint for wood, woodchips, and wood products. Gain a slight bonus for selling direct on your farm.
> - Industrial Sawmill (production) : Producing planks and allowing direct selling or delivery of your wood. Also produce long planks and wood beams with the Platinum Edition enabled!
>
> STYLES:
> - Industrial Sawmill : The default look for the sawmill with an overall "used" look. Not a showroom sawmill, this is a working sawmill!
> - Rusted Industrial Sawmill : They don't make them like they used to! This sawmill has stood the test of time, but is rusted to it's core after the paint flaked away. Still works, though!
>
> Placement Note: If you wish to place a shed over the sawmill - place the shed first, then using free-placement mode, place the sawmill under the shed.
